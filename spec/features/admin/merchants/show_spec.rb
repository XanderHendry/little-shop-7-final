  # 26. Admin Merchant Update

# As an admin,
# When I visit a merchant's admin show page (/admin/merchants/:merchant_id)
# Then I see a link to update the merchant's information.
# When I click the link
# Then I am taken to a page to edit this merchant
# And I see a form filled in with the existing merchant attribute information
# When I update the information in the form and I click ‘submit’
# Then I am redirected back to the merchant's admin show page where I see the updated information
# And I see a flash message stating that the information has been successfully updated.
